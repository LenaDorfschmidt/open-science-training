1. You will learn how to create a folder structure and file naming system that is simple and easy to understand without the author's explanation in [Data and File Management](data_and_file_management.html).
2. You will create [R Markdown](rmarkdown.html) files to analyze your data and document your result in a single, easily sharable document. 
3. You will learn how to use [Version Control](git.html) control in order to handle changes to files in a structured and well-document way.

</div>

<div class="column-right">
1. Install [R Version 3.0.1 or higher](https://cran.rstudio.com). 
2. Download and install [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) 
</div>

## Create a Github account

</div>


<div class="column-right">
1.  Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads). You can find the instructions to install Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com) if you don’t already have one. 

For your username...

* consider using lower-case letters, making it as short as you can.
* incorporate your actual name, it makes your username easier for people to remember.
* consider re-using your username from other contexts e.g. Twitter.

Further, you may want to use your “.ac.uk” email for your account, since this allows you to request free private repositories via GitHub Education.

## Install Git

First, let's figure out if you already have git installed. Go to the shell and enter `which git` to request the path to your Git executable:

```
which git
## /usr/bin/git
```
If this is successfull: great! Move on to the next section. If not, then you should install git. 

## Mac
If you have homebrew installed, you can type `brew install git` in the command line. Should you not have homebrew installed, you can also install git from here: http://git-scm.com/downloads

## Windows

For windows users, I'd recommend you install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org). Use the default settings except for when asked about 'When asked about 'Adjusting your PATH environment': Here, select ', make sure to select 'Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software'.

## Linux

On Linux, you can install git by typing `sudo apt-get install git`.
